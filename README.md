# ARViz

Intelligent Robotics http://intelligentrobotics.es/ @IntellRobotLabs 

ARViz is an RViz implementation for Augmented Reality. This application runs inside the Microsoft Hololens AR device as a UWP application, without the need to use Ros Bridge. This project has as goal to combine:

* ROS2 C # support for UWP applications on board Microsoft Hololens.
* TF2 support for ROS C#.
* Secure communications.
* Hololens Positioning in the scene.

This project uses the [UWP port of ROS2](https://github.com/esteve/ros2_dotnet) done by [Esteve Fernández](https://github.com/esteve). You can have a look at the talk he gave at ROSCon 2018 about ROS2 for Android, iOS and UWP to understand the underlying code [Video](https://vimeo.com/293302046) [Slides](https://roscon.ros.org/2018/presentations/ROSCon2018_ROS2%20for%20Android,%20iOS%20and%20Universal%20Windows%20Platform.pdf).

This project is funded by [ROSIN](http://rosin-project.eu/) as a focused Technical Project.
